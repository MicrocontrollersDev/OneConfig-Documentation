# Elements

OneConfig currently uses a proprietary element system, which is pending a rewrite due to its lack of portability and readability. When we update this to a new system, you will be able to use the components OneConfig has to happen in your own code.



{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning: We are discouraging you from using the current OneConfig elements found in the** `cc.polyfrost.oneconfig.elements` **package. Once they have been rewritten, these will become publicly available with documentation.**
{% endhint %}
