# Notifications

OneConfig has an extensive notifications system which you can use to inform the player of various events that have happened, for example how much EXP they have just got from a game.&#x20;



They support click actions, text, progress bars, and animations to make them look pretty and functional for your code, plus they can be queued!

For even more information, you can check out the javadocs for the Notifications class.
