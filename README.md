# Introduction

Welcome to the OneConfig documentation for developers and designers. If you're confused about how to integrate your mod with OneConfig, or just what something does, there's a good chance the answer is here.

Keep in mind though, that these docs aren't perfect, so if something is wrong, feel free to [fix it yourself](https://github.com/Polyfrost/OneConfig-Documentation/), before we even notice.
